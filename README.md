This repository contains all the code I developed during my internship at Skills Up Global. The projects included here were created both for the company and for a bootcamp designed to train high school students. The files in this repository may or may not be directly related to each other, as I worked primarily as a Python developer but also took on responsibilities in robotics. Since I am currently an intern, the contents of this repo may continue to evolve as I upload more work.
